## Overview of the Statistical Analysis

This analysis was performed to convince an investor to open surf shop in Oahu. In order to analyze weather data that was compiled in a SQLite Database, we utilized SQLAlchemy to pull descriptive statistics on the weather data. Specifically, we filtered data for both December and June to see the weather patterns for these months. 

## Results


The results for December and June are as follows:
<BR>

- The December average temperature is 71 Degrees.
- The lowest temperature recorded for the time period analyzed was 56 degrees. 
- The high was 83 degrees.

- The lowest and highest temperatures recorded for this time period were 64 and 85 degrees respectively.

## Summary:

The temperatures recorded on Oahu during June and December are very similar. While the low temperature in December is 8 degrees lower than June, there is very little variation between summer and winter. 

In addition to temperatures, we could also create new queries to look at precipitation, as we did in this week's module. We could further analyze by filtering for June and December to compare the two months. This will either provide more definitive proof that the seasons have relatively stable weather, or perhaps show that temperature was not a good stand alone indicator to show weather variation across months.
